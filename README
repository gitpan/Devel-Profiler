Devel::Profiler 0.02

This module implements a Perl profiler that outputs profiling data in
a format compatible with "dprofpp", Devel::DProf's profile analysis
tool.  It is meant to be a drop-in replacement for Devel::DProf.

NOTE: If Devel::DProf works for your application then there is no
reason to use this module.

CHANGES

   - Fixed implementation of caller() override to more closely match
     normal behavior.

   - Added fork protection like Devel::DProf - only profile the parent.

   - Added code to avoid instrumenting fake subs.  For details, see: 

       http://perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=168546

   - Added code to detect constant subs and avoid profiling them.

   - Added Devel::Profiler::Apache module which works like
     Apache::DProf to provide profiling for Apache/mod_perl.

   - Added check for dprofpp to Makefile.PL - thanks are due to
     "Automated Perl Test Account" for the catch.

   - Fixed bug under Test::More version 0.44 where Test::More was
     confused by my attempts to test skip() itself.  Thanks to Andreas
     Marcel Riechert for the report.

   - Added package_filter option to allow more flexible control over
     packages to be profiled.  Thanks to Simon Rosenthal for inspiring
     this feature.
