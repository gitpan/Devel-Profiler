Devel::Profiler 0.03

This module implements a Perl profiler that outputs profiling data in
a format compatible with "dprofpp", Devel::DProf's profile analysis
tool.  It is meant to be a drop-in replacement for Devel::DProf.

NOTE: If Devel::DProf works for your application then there is no
reason to use this module.

CHANGES

   - Added hz option and code to scale output the hz.  This should
     improve speed and smooth discrepencies between the accuracy of
     times() and Time::HiRes.

   - Added ability to pass options to Devel::Profiler::Apache.

   - Allow package_filter to take an array of filters.

   - Fixed bug where Devel::Profiler::Apache would initialize
     Devel::Profiler more than once, resulting in garbled output.

   - Set required Perl version to 5.6.0 rather than 5.6.1.  Testing
     needed.

   - Devel::Profiler::Apache now logs when it opens a new profiler
     output file.

   - Added sub_filter option to allow flexible exclusion of subs.

   - Added Devel::Profiler::Apache to MANIFEST.  Now it will actually
     be incldued in the release!  Thanks Jasper Zhao for the spot.
